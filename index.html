      <h2>How to Remove Vocals from a Song</h2>
      <p>Follow these steps to create karaoke tracks or isolate vocals using Marin AI's vocal remover:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Select Audio Source</strong>: Choose whether to input a YouTube or SoundCloud link or upload an MP3/WAV file. Use the "Audio Source" dropdown to make your selection.</li>
        <li><strong>Provide Audio Input</strong>: If selecting a link, paste the valid YouTube or SoundCloud URL in the "Audio URL" field. For file uploads, click the "Upload Audio File" field to select an MP3 or WAV file from your device.</li>
        <li><strong>Choose Number of Stems</strong>: Select the number of stems (2, 4, or 5) you want to separate from the audio using the "Number of Stems" dropdown. Stems can include vocals, drums, bass, piano, and other instruments, depending on the selection.</li>
        <li><strong>Select Output Preference</strong>: Choose between "Process with Mixer" to adjust the separated stems interactively or "Direct Download ZIP" to receive all stems as a downloadable ZIP file.</li>
        <li><strong>Start Processing</strong>: Click the "PROCESS" button to initiate vocal removal. A loading screen will appear with the message "Please wait, our AI models are processing..." and a progress video. Processing typically takes about one minute.</li>
        <li><strong>Download or Adjust Output</strong>: Once processing is complete, you will either be directed to the mixer interface (if selected) to fine-tune the stems or prompted to download a ZIP file containing the separated stems.</li>
        <li><strong>Review and Use</strong>: Use the isolated stems for karaoke, remixing, or music production. Ensure the output meets your needs, and reprocess with different settings if necessary.</li>
      </ol>
      <p><strong>Note</strong>: For best results, use high-quality audio sources. Ensure you have the necessary permissions to process and use the audio for your intended purpose.</p>
